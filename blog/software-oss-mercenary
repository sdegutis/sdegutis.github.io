# Software OSS Mercenary

Many, many times, I wanted a feature in some open source project that wasn't more than a day's work,
but being busy myself, I couldn't make it, and no one else would, and the team didn't prioritize it.

I'm willing to try an experiment to solve this. I'm putting myself out there for hire
to submit PRs that resolve specific, small issues on *any open source project* on GitHub.

Whether it's a bug you need fixed or a feature you want implemented,
I'm willing to spend a few hours or days working on getting it working for you,
for a proportionate fee somehow. (I haven't quite worked that part out yet.)

For now, it'll just be TypeScript or JavaScript libraries I can work on.
If you have something you want to fix, email me at sbdegutis@gmail.com
and we can discuss the problem, price and timeframe.

I'm not likely to say yes to anyone,
so our discussion would be more of a hypothetical thought experiment.
But who knows, something might work out.
